The present prototype aims to facilitate the scheduled feeding of overweighed pets and clean surfaces. Nowadays, most of pet owners invest a lot of time in taking proper care of their pets and do household chores, especially when they work. That's why pets tend to have unhealthy eating habits, such as obesity. Similarly, since owners are absent, it is hard to clean the house. In that sense, we designed a Feeder-Cleaning Robot which is Bluetooth enabled and automatic. The user can operate the robot through an app, which offers customizable programming options for the pet's mealtime needs from the convenience of your phone as well as scheduled cleaning. It is expected for the robot to avoid obstacles accurately and deliver portions of the food initially input without hindering the cleaning functionality. Also, our design is symmetric so that the robot moves smoothly around the house. All these features make the robot user friendly for users of all ages having one pet or more.

This project was fully funded by College of Engineering, Seoul National University.
